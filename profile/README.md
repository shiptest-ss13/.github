## Shiptest 13

Shiptest 13 is a fork of Space Station 13 (specifically /tg/station-whitesands code) centering around exploration of the universe. 
Gameplay takes place on ships, which can be flown in an "overmap" which represents areas you can travel in solar systems and beyond. 
Shiptest, like many other SS13 servers, is driven on player interaction. 
Doubly so as not only are you interacting with friendly members of your own crew, but also neutral and even hostile members of other crews. 
Exploration is another focus, as planets and drifting ruins can be found just by flying ships around the system. 
You'll never know what you'll get 'till you find it!
